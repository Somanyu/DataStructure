# **Queue Data Structure**
*Queue* is an abstract data type(ADT) which performs operations similar to ![Stack Data Structure](https://github.com/Somanyu/DataStructure/tree/main/Stack) except it follows FIFO order *i.e* First In First Out. 

## Real life examples of Stack Data Structure:
A perfect real life example for Queue is when you are standing in queue for bus tickets/train tickets. The first person to enter the queue is the first person to leave the queue after receiving the ticket.
