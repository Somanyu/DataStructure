# **Linked List Data Structure**  :train:
*Linked List* is a linear data stucture that consists of nodes connected with each other. Each node is present randomly in the memory and connected to each other via links (pointers).
Node consists of two parts, one is data part that consists of data and other is link which has the pointer that points to it to the next node.
