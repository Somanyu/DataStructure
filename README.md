## **What is Data Structure ?**
*Data Structure* is a method of organizing, managing and storing data in various formats that enables us to modifiy them and access them with ease.

<br>

## **What is Algorithm ?**
*Algorithm* is any well defined computational procedure that takes some value
or set of values as input and produces some value or set of values as output. 

<br>

## **Why Data Structures & Algorithm are important ?**
With increase in data, it will be difficult to work on those datas efficiently which will affect the speed of the application.
With *Data Structures & Algorithms* we can work on any amount of data with memory efficiency, increase in processing and abstraction.

<br>

## **There are two types of Data Structures:**
1. Linear Data Structure
    * Arrays
    * Stacks
    * Queues
    * Linked list

2. Non-linear Data Structure
    * Trees
    * Graphs

<br>

## **Basic Operations (or) Algorithms performed on Data Structure:**
### **1. Insertion:** adds a new data item in the data structure
### **2. Deletion:** deletes a existing data item in the data structure
### **3. Traversal:** access each data item exactly once so that it can be processed
### **4. Searching:** find out the location of the data item if it exits in data structure
### **5. Sorting:** arranging the data items in some order
